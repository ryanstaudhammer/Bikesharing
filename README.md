# Citi bikesharing information with Tableau
## Overview
In this terribly written module we were given the task of using Tableau to visualize information about a bike sharing program in New York City. Sounds fun, huh? Well by this part of the course I have come to understand that there are multiple errors in most of the modules and as the pupil who is paying good money to learn a new skill, I am beyond upset. The last time I went to college almost twenty years ago we had these things called textbooks. At the time paying over $100 per text book seemed obsurd, but at least they were peer reviewed and edited by the publishing company. It is obvious to me that is not the case for these modules. Here is a chat I made for the story that won't fit with the rest of the images I was instructed to include in my story:
