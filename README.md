# Citi bikesharing information with Tableau
## Overview
In this terribly written module we were given the task of using Tableau to visualize information about a bike sharing program in New York City. 
## Results
A module about visualizations and a bikesharing operation in NYC? Sounds fun, huh? Well it wasn't because once again this module had many errors. By this part of the course I have come to understand that there are multiple errors in MOST of the modules and as a pupil who is paying good money to learn a new skill, I am beyond upset. The last time I went to college almost twenty years ago we had these things called textbooks. At the time paying over $100 per text book seemed absurd, but at least they were peer reviewed and edited by the publishing company. It is obvious to me that is not the case for these modules. Here is a chart I made for the story that won't fit with the rest of the images I was instructed to include in my story:

## Summary
This findings in this module are as follows:
- Tableau is a cool visualization tool in which previous work cannot be saved unless a license is purchased... so what's the point?
- The modules are inconsistent and have not been reviewed or purged of errors recently.
- This course was not worth the money I paid to take it when most of this information is free to learn online in other ways.
